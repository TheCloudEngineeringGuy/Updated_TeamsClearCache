# Updated_TeamsClearCache
This script is will help with simple user related issues due to cache. 

I created this script for end users in mind. The vision is to have a Teams Repair icon sit on the user's desktop. When issues or small bugs arrise, the teams repair script will perform the basics

1. The teams excutable file is ended.
2. Cache at the new location for Microsoft Teams is cleared. #Entire Folder deleted
3. MS Teams is restarted

Within this repo I will also include the deployment shortcut code.


The communication to your end users would be to try the repair tool first, and if issues persist, please create a ticket for more advanced troubleshooting




Note: The only current hump with this deployment is the path version of teams is not static. As updates to Microsoft Teams rollout the path also changes. This will prevent the code from executing. Reviewing workarounds to this currently.
